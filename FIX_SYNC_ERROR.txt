GOOGLE DRIVE SYNC SETUP GUIDE
============================

Follow these steps EXACTLY to ensure sync works without "Auth Error" or "Malformed Code".

1. GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE
-----------------------
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Create or select a project.
- Search for "Google Drive API" and click ENABLE.
- Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen":
    - User Type: External.
    - Add your email and developer info.
    - App Name: "TruNotes V2".
    - Scopes: Add ".../auth/drive.file".
    - Test Users: Add your own Gmail address (IMPORTANT).
- Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials":
    - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
    - Application Type: SELECT "Desktop app".
    - Name it "TruNotes Desktop".
    - Click CREATE.
- Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

2. TRUNOTES APP SETTINGS
------------------------
- Open TruNotes (Release v5).
- Go to Settings > Sync.
- Paste your Client ID and Client Secret.
- Ensure Redirect URI is set to: http://localhost
- Click "Save Keys".
- Click "Log In".
- In the browser window that opens:
    - Log in to your Gmail.
    - You might see "Google hasn't verified this app" -> Click Advanced > Go to TruNotes (unsafe).
    - Allow permissions.
    - You will then see an error like "This site can’t be reached" (localhost refused connect).
    - LOOK AT THE ADDRESS BAR. Copy the code at the end: `code=4/0AbUR...`
    - (The app will now handle it even if you copy the whole URL or the code= part).
- Paste the code into TruNotes and click "Verify & Connect".
